Repo for my work and study of Marlin for the Series1 3D printer by Type A Machines

Goals:
Optimize Marlin, anrduino firmware for 3D printers, to reach a higher state of reliability and function.

Generating Devel Branch for change pull requests.

Generating clean-up branch to start removing features and code not used with the TAM series1 printers.
